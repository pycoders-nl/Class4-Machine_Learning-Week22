# Class4-Machine_Learning-Week22 - Assignment

We will use the dataset linked at https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package. 
Since we are at the beginning of machine learning topics, we will not be concerned with NAN values. The variables we will use are as follows: 
‘Location’, ‘MinTemp’, MaxTemp, WindGustDir, WindGustSpeed, WindSpeed9am, WindSpeed3pm, Pressure9am, Pressure3pm.

You are expected to develop a model that predicts the maximum temperature by using these variables and by using the Multiple Linear, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet and Polynomial regressions we have covered so far. While performing these operations, cross validation and dummy variables will also be used. The performance measurements of the models will be listed in an Excel table and the results will be stated by making an estimation for 1 observation. You can reach the excel table from this link >  "https://github.com/pycoders-nl/Class4-Machine_Learning-Week22/blob/main/performance_table.xls"
Note: You will see on excel table that >> sheet-1 > Observation, sheet-2> the field which you will put into the  performance measurements.


Success!
